# Frequently Asked QUestions: Conscious Language Program

## What is a "conscious language" effort?

The software industry has fallen in to the habit of using certain words, like blacklist, and slave, without giving a lot of thought to the emotional baggage that these words carry.

The phrase "conscious language" refers to selecting words and phrases consciously, intentionally, considering connotations as well as denotations. We encourage projects to choose phrases that clearly ommunicate the technical meaning, without using metaphors or colloqualisms.

This has the dual meaning of removing problematic terms, and also communicating more clearly, particularly to those who are working in a secondary language.

Our goals are to identify where problematic terms are used, collaborate on replacement terminology, support project contributors in making updates, and report on joint progress.

## Why is this important?

If open source is truly meant to be inclusive and a place where anyone can participate, it must be welcoming to all.
If words or phrases convey secondary unintended meanings to our audience, we are choosing to limit participation in our projects, which is antithetical to this goal.

## What terms are we recommending you consider?

We have identified the terms "master/slave" and "whitelist/blacklist" to work on because these are considered most visible and problematic across the industry.

Over time, we may recommend consideration of other terms, such as words that reference mental health, gender, physical handicaps, and several other categories.

## What are the recommended replacement terms?

To proceed, teams should follow the [recommendations outlined by the Linux kernel](https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/7/4/229).
These recommendations have informed the terminology recommendations we provide below. 

To ensure consistency and success, it is imperative for product team stakeholders to align internally.
For example, documentation teams should engage in discussions with their engineering leadership to reach an agreement on replacement terms.
This will ensure that the product documentation will match the code.

When master refers to the main branch, our recommendation is to replace it with main.

Our recommendations for master/slave terminology are:

 * primary / secondary
 * source / replica
 * initiator, requester / responder
 * controller, host / device, worker, proxy
 * director / performer

Our recommendations for blacklist/whitelist terminology are:

 * denylist / allowlist
 * blocklist / passlist

If your project opts to use some other term or phrase, please [let us know](https://github.com/conscious-lang/conscious-lang-docs/issues) that youâ€™ve done so, and why, so that we can learn from your decisions.

## Oh no! Slippery slope! Newspeak!

We've heard concerns that this initiative puts us on a slippery slope to Newspeak portrayed in the 1984 dystopia by George Orwell.
This initiative is completely different from Newspeak.
Newspeak involved multiple changes but the most essential were:

 * Removing precise words in favor of general words so that it would become difficult to form precise thoughts
 * Using the opposite word for the true situation to disguise what's really happening

Everything in the conscious language initiative is *the exact opposite* of that.

For example, "denylist" is both more precise and more accurate than "blacklist".

"Primary" is both more precise and more accurate than "master" in projects that have made that switch.

The goal of this project is to use more precise words, in order to avoid unintended connotations that some common words and phrases have.
Not only does this eliminate the hurt caused by those connotations, it also improves understanding, particularly for people who are reading in a second language, where those idioms may be confusing.

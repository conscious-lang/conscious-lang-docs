# Conscious Language in your Open Source Projects

Red Hat has committed to removing problematic language from software
that we contribute to and release. This repository contains documents
about that process.

This includes:

 * [Best Practice and Recommendations](https://github.com/conscious-lang/conscious-lang-docs/blob/master/recommendations.md)
 * [Frequently Asked Questions](https://github.com/conscious-lang/conscious-lang-docs/blob/master/faq.md)
